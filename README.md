Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures

# Project Title

This project is a collection of Data Structures and algorithnms implemented with Javascript.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Clone or download then run on Google chrome and open the developer tools and finally open up the console. There is the output of each script.

## Running the tests

No tests so far but this is a project that will heavily benefit from automated tests so I will look into this in the future.

## Built With

- Plain Javascript
- HTML5

## Contributing

You may send in a pull request to add any Javascript algorithms and data structures of your own that you want to show off. All you need to do is make a new javascript file name it with a descriptive and unique name and lastly, also include a short description of what the algorithm or data structure it is.
